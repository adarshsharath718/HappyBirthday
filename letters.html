        <h2>THE BGMI</h2>
        <p>
          Hey Love,

        <p>Who would’ve thought that a simple Snap would lead to such an amazing adventure together? From the moment you
          sent me your game ID, something just clicked. I still remember how excited I was to send you that friend
          request—and how it felt when you accepted.
        </p>

        <p>Our first battles in Erangel were so much fun. It was as if every victory and every defeat pulled us closer,
          letting us discover new things about each other.
        </p>

        <p>Then you introduced me to the Nusa map, and suddenly, our world in the game became even bigger—new places to
          explore and new memories to create with you by my side.
        </p>

        <p>We’ve played so many matches together since then, and every single one has been special. It’s not really
          about
          winning or losing, but about those laughs we share in the lobby, those epic saves, and, most importantly,
          having you as my favorite teammate.
        </p>

        <p>Thank you for making even the most ordinary matches unforgettable. I’m grateful for every moment, both in the
          game and out, that I get to share with you. Here’s to countless more matches, more adventures, and a love
          story that started with a Snap and keeps growing every day.
        </p>
        <p> Yours,<br> PAPACHI❤️ </p>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p> Hey Love, </p>
        <p> I still remember that magical night of Ganesh Chaturthi. It happened so suddenly—one moment we were just
          ourselves, sharing laughs and little stories, and then, out of nowhere, I found myself pouring my heart out
          and proposing to you. My heart was racing, unsure and excited all at once, and when you said “yes,” the world
          felt like it had shifted just for us. </p>
        <p> But it was what you asked next that truly touched me: “Will you convince my parents?” That question stayed
          with me, deeper than anything else. In that moment, I realized how much this meant to both of us—not just our
          journey together, but every step we’d have to walk with courage, honesty, and love. </p>
        <p> Our story has grown stronger ever since. Every day, I feel more certain about us and about facing every
          challenge, no matter how big or small, hand in hand. Just knowing that we began this chapter together, with
          such honesty and hope, makes me even more committed to making it all work—for you, for us, and for the future
          we dream of. </p>
        <p> Thank you for being my partner through it all. Here’s to every step ahead—convincing, loving, and building
          our story one day at a time. </p>
        <p> Yours,<br> PAPACHI❤️ </p>
        </p>

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <p> Hey Love, </p>
        <p> From casual snaps to deep conversations, it all began with just a few filters and playful messages. Who knew
          that behind every silly face and emoji, something real was growing? I found myself waiting for your snap,
          smiling at your replies, and slowly, unknowingly, falling for you. </p>
        <p> As the days went by, our conversations deepened. We moved past filters and selfies into late-night chats and
          morning greetings. Those moments became the soft threads that stitched us closer. You became my comfort
          space—someone I could laugh with, open up to, and be entirely myself around. </p>
        <p> And then we met—truly met. That first time, my heart was racing. Your shy smile, the way you looked at me,
          and the silence we both didn’t mind—it all felt surreal. It wasn’t just a meeting. It was magic unfolding in
          front of my eyes. </p>
        <p> Then came that unforgettable night—Ganesh Chaturthi. I don’t know what took over me, but suddenly, I found
          myself telling you what I’d been feeling for so long. And you said “yes.” That moment shifted something inside
          me. Everything felt lighter, warmer, right. </p>
        <p> But what truly moved me was what came next: “Will you convince my parents?” That question hit deep. It
          wasn’t just about us anymore—it was about everything we wanted to build. I knew then that this love was real,
          serious, and worth every step. </p>
        <p> Our journey since has been filled with the sweetest memories—meeting on weekends, eating our favorite food,
          sharing laughs, and sitting quietly when words weren’t needed. Every hug, every goodbye, every plan for the
          next time kept me going. </p>
        <p> Of course, not every day was perfect. We faced our share of misunderstandings, distance, and tough moments.
          But through it all, we chose each other. Again and again. And that’s what love is, isn’t it? Not perfect, but
          persistent. </p>
        <p> We’ve grown together—learning, unlearning, supporting, and loving. You’ve been my biggest strength and my
          safest place. And with every moment, I feel more certain about us, our journey, and the life we’re slowly
          building. </p>
        <p> I know there’s still a long road ahead—many more steps, many more moments to cherish, and yes, many more
          challenges to face. But I’m ready. With you by my side, I’m ready for it all. </p>
        <p> Forever yours,<br> PAPACHI ❤️ </p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p> Hey Love, </p>
        <p> As I sit and think about everything we’ve been through, my heart fills with gratitude—not just for our past,
          but for everything we’re yet to build. We've come a long way, and yet the most beautiful part is knowing how
          much more lies ahead of us. </p>
        <p> I promise to stand by you through every academic milestone. Whether it's preparing for exams, cheering you
          on through interviews, or simply helping you stay calm during the stress of it all—I will be your biggest
          supporter. Your growth inspires me, and together, I know we’ll keep pushing each other to become the best
          versions of ourselves. </p>
        <p> Spiritually too, I promise to grow with you. To find peace in the little things, to pray not just for
          myself, but for our future, and to always believe that there's a higher power watching over our journey. I
          will sit with you in silence when you need strength, and I will whisper hope into your heart when the world
          feels heavy. </p>
        <p> Most of all, I promise to nurture our togetherness. To protect the bond we’ve built, to be present in both
          the ordinary and the extraordinary moments. Whether it's sitting in a cafe after a long week, taking a walk
          under the stars, or simply doing nothing together—I’ll treasure it all. </p>
        <p> I know life won't always be smooth. There will be days when we feel tired, unsure, or even distant. But in
          those moments, I promise to remember why we began. I promise to communicate with kindness, to forgive with an
          open heart, and to hold onto the love we chose every single day. </p>
        <p> With every success we achieve—individually or together—I want us to celebrate not just the destination, but
          the journey we took to get there. I want to build a future with you that is not just filled with achievements,
          but with meaning, balance, and peace. </p>
        <p> So here’s my vow: to grow with you, dream with you, cry and laugh with you, and walk beside you in every
          season—until forever doesn't feel long enough. </p>
        <p> With all my heart,<br> PAPACHI ❤️ </p>
